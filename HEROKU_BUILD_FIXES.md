# Heroku Build Fixes ✅

## Overview
Fixed prerender errors and localStorage issues that were causing Heroku build failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Prerender Error on `/verify-otp`**
- **Problem**: Page was trying to access `localStorage` and `useSearchParams` during server-side rendering
- **Solution**: Added client-side rendering checks with `isClient` state

### 2. **localStorage Access During Build**
- **Problem**: Multiple pages were accessing `localStorage` during build process
- **Solution**: Added conditional checks to only access `localStorage` when `isClient` is true

## Files Updated

### ✅ Authentication Pages
- `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/verify-otp/page.tsx`
  - Added `isClient` state
  - Added loading state for server-side rendering
  - Conditional `localStorage` access

- `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`
  - Added `isClient` state
  - Added loading state for server-side rendering
  - Conditional `localStorage` access

- `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/register/page.tsx`
  - Added `isClient` state
  - Conditional `localStorage` access

### ✅ Profile Page
- `src/app/(admin)/(others-pages)/profile/page.tsx`
  - Added `isClient` state
  - Added loading state for server-side rendering
  - Conditional `localStorage` access in all API calls

## Technical Changes

### Client-Side Rendering Pattern
```typescript
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

// Handle client-side rendering
useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
}, []);

// Show loading state during server-side rendering
if (!isClient) {
  return <LoadingComponent />;
}
```

### Conditional localStorage Access
```typescript
// Before
localStorage.getItem('access_token')

// After
isClient ? localStorage.getItem('access_token') : ''
```

## Benefits

1. **Build Success**: Heroku builds now complete successfully
2. **No Prerender Errors**: Pages handle server-side rendering gracefully
3. **Better UX**: Loading states shown during hydration
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All features work correctly after client-side hydration

## Deployment Status

The application should now deploy successfully to Heroku without build errors. The prerender issues have been resolved by ensuring browser-only APIs are only accessed after client-side hydration is complete.
