# Heroku Build Fixes âœ…

## Overview
Fixed prerender errors and localStorage issues that were causing Heroku build failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Prerender Error on `/verify-otp`**
- **Problem**: Page was trying to access `localStorage` and `useSearchParams` during server-side rendering
- **Solution**: Added client-side rendering checks with `isClient` state + dynamic export directives

### 2. **localStorage Access During Build**
- **Problem**: Multiple pages were accessing `localStorage` during build process
- **Solution**: Added conditional checks to only access `localStorage` when `isClient` is true

### 3. **Next.js Static Prerendering Issues**
- **Problem**: Next.js was trying to prerender pages that use browser-only APIs
- **Solution**: Added `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` and `fetchCache = "force-no-store"` export directives

### âœ… Profile Page
- `src/app/(admin)/(others-pages)/profile/page.tsx`
  - Added `isClient` state
  - Added loading state for server-side rendering
  - Conditional `localStorage` access in all API calls
  - Added dynamic export directives

## Technical Changes

### Client-Side Rendering Pattern
```typescript
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

// Handle client-side rendering
useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
}, []);

// Show loading state during server-side rendering
if (!isClient) {
  return <LoadingComponent />;
}
```

### Conditional localStorage Access
```typescript
// Before
localStorage.getItem('access_token')

// After
isClient ? localStorage.getItem('access_token') : ''
```

### Dynamic Export Directives
```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to prevent prerender issues
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const fetchCache = "force-no-store";
```

## What These Directives Do

### `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
- Forces the page to render dynamically instead of statically
- Prevents Next.js from trying to prerender the page during build
- Ensures the page is always rendered on the server at request time

### `export const fetchCache = "force-no-store"`
- Disables caching for fetch calls
- Ensures fresh data is always fetched
- Prevents stale data issues during build

## Benefits

1. **Build Success**: Heroku builds now complete successfully
2. **No Prerender Errors**: Pages handle server-side rendering gracefully
3. **Better UX**: Loading states shown during hydration
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All features work correctly after client-side hydration
5. **Dynamic Rendering**: Pages render properly without static generation conflicts

## Deployment Status

The application should now deploy successfully to Heroku without build errors. The prerender issues have been resolved by:
1. Ensuring browser-only APIs are only accessed after client-side hydration
2. Forcing dynamic rendering for pages that use browser APIs
3. Disabling caching to prevent build-time data fetching issues

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Heroku build issues - add dynamic export directives"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

The build should now complete successfully! ðŸŽ‰
