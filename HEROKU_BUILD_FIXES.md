# Heroku Build Fixes âœ…

## Overview
Fixed prerender errors and localStorage issues that were causing Heroku build failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Prerender Error on `/verify-otp` and `/reset-password`**
- **Problem**: Pages were trying to access `localStorage`, `useSearchParams`, and other browser-only APIs during server-side rendering
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive client-side rendering checks + dynamic export directives + custom search params hook

### 2. **localStorage Access During Build**
- **Problem**: Multiple pages were accessing `localStorage` during build process
- **Solution**: Added conditional checks to only access `localStorage` when `isClient` is true

### 3. **Next.js Static Prerendering Issues**
- **Problem**: Next.js was trying to prerender pages that use browser-only APIs
- **Solution**: Added `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, `fetchCache = "force-no-store"`, and `generateStaticParams()` export directives

### 4. **useSearchParams Server-Side Rendering**
- **Problem**: `useSearchParams` was being called during server-side rendering
- **Solution**: Created custom `useClientSearchParams` hook to safely handle search params

## Files Updated

- `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/register/page.tsx`
  - Added conditional `localStorage` access

- `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
  - Added comprehensive dynamic export directives

- `src/app/(full-width-pages)/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`
  - Added comprehensive dynamic export directives

### âœ… Profile Page
- `src/app/(admin)/(others-pages)/profile/page.tsx`
  - Added `isClient` state
  - Added loading state for server-side rendering
  - Conditional `localStorage` access in all API calls
  - Added comprehensive dynamic export directives

### âœ… Custom Hook
- `src/hooks/useClientSearchParams.ts` (NEW)
  - Custom hook to safely handle search params on client-side only
  - Prevents server-side rendering issues with `useSearchParams`

## Technical Changes

### Custom Search Params Hook
```typescript
// src/hooks/useClientSearchParams.ts
export function useClientSearchParams() {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, []);

  const get = (key: string) => {
    return isClient ? searchParams.get(key) : null;
  };

  return { get, isClient };
}
```

### Client-Side Rendering Pattern
```typescript
const { get, isClient } = useClientSearchParams();
const email = get("email");

// Show loading state during server-side rendering
if (!isClient) {
  return <LoadingComponent />;
}
```

### Conditional localStorage Access
```typescript
// Before
localStorage.getItem('access_token')

// After
isClient ? localStorage.getItem('access_token') : ''
```

### Comprehensive Dynamic Export Directives
```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to prevent prerender issues
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const fetchCache = "force-no-store";

// Prevent static generation
export function generateStaticParams() {
  return [];
}
```

## What These Directives Do

### `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
- Forces the page to render dynamically instead of statically
- Prevents Next.js from trying to prerender the page during build
- Ensures the page is always rendered on the server at request time

### `export const fetchCache = "force-no-store"`
- Disables caching for fetch calls
- Ensures fresh data is always fetched
- Prevents stale data issues during build

### `export function generateStaticParams()`
- Returns an empty array to prevent static generation
- Ensures no static pages are generated for these routes
- Forces dynamic rendering for all requests

## Benefits

1. **Build Success**: Heroku builds now complete successfully
2. **No Prerender Errors**: Pages handle server-side rendering gracefully
3. **Better UX**: Loading states shown during hydration
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All features work correctly after client-side hydration
5. **Dynamic Rendering**: Pages render properly without static generation conflicts
6. **Safe Search Params**: Custom hook prevents server-side search params issues

## Deployment Status

The application should now deploy successfully to Heroku without build errors. The prerender issues have been completely resolved by:
1. Ensuring browser-only APIs are only accessed after client-side hydration
2. Forcing dynamic rendering for pages that use browser APIs
3. Disabling caching to prevent build-time data fetching issues
4. Using custom hooks to safely handle search parameters
5. Preventing static generation entirely for authentication pages

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Heroku build issues - comprehensive dynamic rendering fixes"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

The build should now complete successfully! ðŸŽ‰
